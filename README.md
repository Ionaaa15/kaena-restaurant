# Kaena Restaurant Website

A simple, static website for Kaena Restaurant & Takeaway.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy all files to your web server directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP)
2. Create an `images` folder and move all image files from the old `public/lovable-uploads` folder to it
3. Rename the images to match the references in the code (food1.png, food2.png, etc.)
4. Make sure to have a `background.png` and `logo.png` in the images folder
5. Open the website through your web server (e.g., http://localhost/kaena-restaurant)

No additional setup or Node.js installation is required. This is now a standard static website that can be served by any web server.
